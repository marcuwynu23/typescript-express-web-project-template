# typescript-express-web-project-template

This repository serves as a project template for building web applications using TypeScript and Express.js with Nunjucks as the template engine. It provides a solid foundation and follows best practices for developing robust and scalable web applications.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Leverage the benefits of static typing and advanced JavaScript features provided by TypeScript.

- **Express.js**: Build web applications and APIs easily with Express.js, a fast and flexible web framework for Node.js.

- **Nunjucks Template Engine**: Integrate Nunjucks, a powerful and extensible templating engine, to dynamically generate HTML pages and serve them to clients.

- **Routing and Controllers**: Organize your application's routes and separate concerns by defining routes and binding them to corresponding controller functions.

- **Middleware**: Implement custom middleware functions for handling common tasks such as logging, authentication, error handling, and more.

- **Static File Serving**: Serve static files like HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript for building full-stack web applications.

- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully with centralized error handling middleware to provide consistent error responses.

- **Environment Configuration**: Configure your application easily for different environments using environment variables.

- **Testing and Debugging**: Set up unit tests using a testing framework like Jest and utilize popular debuggers for TypeScript to ensure code quality and reliability.

- **Deployment**: The template is designed to facilitate easy deployment to various hosting platforms and provides a solid foundation for containerization using Docker.
